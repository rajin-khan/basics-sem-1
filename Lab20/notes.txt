Final question types:

- recursion
- 1D array
- 2D array
- structure + file
- pointer
- (maybe output finding stuff)


for fwrite, the structure is: fwrite(s /* the string or whatever you wanna read */, sizeof(s[0]) /* size of each element in the structure or the array */, NUM_STUDENTS /* how many elements you wanna write in the file */ , f /* the file pointer */);
remember, fwrite always writes or creates files in b i n a r y , so it isn't really understandable even if you open the .txt file.

for fread, the structure is: fread(s, sizeof(s[0]), num /* here, in fread, this is actually the max number of elements in the databse */, f);

if you return an int value from fread, it actually returns the number of successful reads in total, so, from a database, you could technically read the number of students in that database, by just using fread.

questions in the finals will include reading and writing from files.

REMEMBER PT2, fread and fwrite is better, but it reads it in binary and writes in binary in your file, so maybe you can use fscanf and fprintf, since t h o s e two read and write normal text.

but, you can use fscanf(stream, "[^\n]%*c", &char); so it reads the string until new line, but doesn't read the new line itself, and drops the last thing that it reads using *c.
