/*

This program that determines a studentâ€™s grade.
The program will read three scores and determine the grade based on the following rules:

if the average score is equal to or above 90%, grade = A 
if the average score is between 70% and 89.99%, grade = B 
if the average score is between 50% and 69.99%, grade = C 
if the average score is below 50%, grade = F
