## programming fundamentals

all codes from my first semester in uni.
we primarily used C and learned computing basics. 

the directory named "project" contains the raw code for a basic terminal based management system (for our first semester project),
however a separate repo on my profile exists for that project, named UNIX.

this is meant to be a backup of my raw code from uni, so the comments may include profanity and strong language. discretion is advised.
